# sa.amos user manual

sa.engine is an extensible NoSQL database system that allows different kinds of data sources to be integrated and queried. The system is centered around an object-oriented and functional query language, AmosQL, documented here. The system can store data in its internal main-memory object store. In AmosQL queries variables are bound to instances of objects of any kind (domain calculus), in contrast to SQL where variables in queries always have to be bound to rows in tables (tuple calculus). Queries in terms of function compositions over sets of objects make AmosQL queries versatile.

sa.amos includes primitives for data mining through queries and functions to group, aggregate, transform, and visualize data. Ordered collections are supported through the datatype `Vector`. Queries can produce ordered results as vectors.

Several distributed sa.amos peers can collaborate in a federation. The documentation includes descriptions of basic peer communication primitives.

sa.engine enables wrappers to be defined for different kinds of data sources and external storage managers accessed to make them queryable. A predefined wrapper for relational databases allows queries combining relational data with other kinds of data accessible through sa.amos.

This manual describes how to use the Amos II system and the AmosQL query language. The principles of sa.amos and AmosQL are described in the document [^RJK03].

## Organization of documentation

This document is organized as follows:

-   [Chapter 1](getting-started/README.md) gives some basic information on how to download and get started running the system. It also mentions different subsystems available.
-   [Chapter 2](amosql/README.md) describes the core of the AmosQL query language, including how to define database schemas, populate, query, and update the database.
-   [Chapter 3](procedural-functions/README.md) describes procedural extensions to AmosQL making it possible to implement algorithms that have side effects updating the database.
-   In addition to AmosQL the system can process also SQL (SQL-92) queries, as described in [Chapter 4](sql-processor/README.md).
-   The mechanisms for setting up federations of distributed Amos II peers are described in [Chapter 5](peer-management/README.md).
-   Amos II has mechanisms to access external systems and to integrate and query external databases managed by different kinds of external data managers. The extensibility mechanisms are described in [Chapter 6](accessing-external-systems/README.md).
-   [Chapter 7](system-functions/README.md) documents built-in system functions.Â 
-   [Chapter 8](references/README.md) gives some references to related documents.
