## User defined derived functions

__The following function finds the incomes higher than a given threshold. It is a function returning a bag (set with duplicates) of numbers__

```sql
create function higherIncomes (Number thres) -> Bag of Number
  as select income(p)
       from Person p
      where income(p)>thres;
```

__Call function `highIncomes()`__

```sql
higherIncomes(500);
```

__Function highIncomesPers() returns both names and incomes. It is a function returning a bag of tuples (pairs)__

```sql
create function higherIncomePers (Number thres)
                                -> Bag of (Charstring nm, Number inc)
  as select name(p), inc
       from Number inc, Person p
      where income(p)=inc
        and inc > thres;
```

__Call tuple valued function: Get persons earning more than 100__

```sql
higherIncomePers(500);
```

__The following function returns the k highest paid persons__

```sql
create function highestIncomePers(Number k)
                                -> Bag of (Charstring nm, Number inc)
  as select name(p), income(p)
        from Person p
      order by income(p) desc
      limit k;
```

__Get the tho highest earners__

```sql
highestIncomePers(2);
```

## Collections

### Bags

__The function iota() returns a bag of integers in an interval__

```sql
iota(2,6);
```

__You can assign a variable to a bag valued function__

```sql
set :b = iota(1,10);
:b;
```

__Use in() to extract values from bag__

```sql
in(:b);
```
__Alternatively 'in' operator__

```sql
select x from Number x where x in :b;
```

__Aggregate functions over bags__

```sql
set :b = iota(1,100000);

count(:b);
sum(:b);
avg(:b);
stdev(:b);
maxagg(:b);
minagg(:b);

sum(select n
      from Number n
     where n in :b
     limit 20);
```

__Aggregation over bags__

```sql
set :b2 = iota(1,30);

sum(select x from Number x where x in :b2 and x>7);

set :b3 = (select x from Number x where x in :b2 and x > 7);

sum(:b3);

avg(:b3);
```

### Vectors (ordered collections)

__Set interface variable :v0 to value of query forming a VECTOR {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} by using vselect instead of select__

```sql
set :v0 = vselect i from Number i where i in iota(1,10) order by i;
:v0;
```

__Set :v to the square root of elements in :v0__

```sql
set :v = vselect sqrt(i) from Number i where i in :v0 order by i;
:v;
```

__Basic vector aggregation__

```sql
dim(:v);
vsum(:v);
vavg(:v);
vstdev(:v);
```

__The 'in' operator converts vector to bag__

```sql
select n
  from Number n
 where n in {1,2,3}
   and n >= 2;
```

__Represent coordinates as 2D vectors__

```sql
set :c1 = {1,2};
set :c2 = {3,4};
```

__Euclidean coordinate distance__

```sql
euclid(:c1, :c2);
```

__Vectors can hold objects of any datatype__

```sql
{1,3,{3,4}};
{1,"a",{"b","c"}};
```

__Save database in file mydb.dmp__

```sql
save "mydb.dmp";
```

__After saving the interface variables are lost__

```sql
:b;
```

__Quit sa.amos__

```sql
quit;
```

__Run sa.amos again with the save database__

```
sa.amos mydb.dmp
```

__Inspect the database again__

```sql
higherIncomePers(100);
```
