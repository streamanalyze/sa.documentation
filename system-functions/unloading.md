# Unloading

The data stored in the local database can be unloaded to a text file
as an *unload script* of AmosQL statements generated by the
system. The state of the database can be restored by loading the
unload script as any other AmosQL file. Unloading is useful for
backups and for transporting data between different systems such as
different sa.amos versions or sa.amos systems running on different
computers. The unload script can be edited in case the schema has
changed.

```
   unload(Charstring filename) -> Boolean
```
generates an AmosQL script that restores the current local database state if loaded into sa.amos with the same schema as the current one.

Functions can be marked to be exclude from being unloaded by storing then in the table:
```
   excluded_fns() -> Bag of Function
```
