# Unloading

The data stored in the local database can be unloaded to a text file as an *unload script* of AmosQL statements generated by the system. The state of the database can be restored by loading the unload script as any other AmosQL file. Unloading is useful for backups and for transporting data between different systems such as different Amos II versions or Amos II systems running on different computers. The unload script can be edited in case the schema has changed.

```
unload(Charstring filename)->Boolean
```
generates an AmosQL script that restores the current local database state if loaded into an Amos II peer with the same schema as the current one.

```
excluded_fns()->Bag of Function
```
set of functions that should not be unloaded. Can be updated by user.
